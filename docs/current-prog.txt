What has been achieved?

React frontend is up and running
Java backend is up and running
Postgres is ready to go
Postgres DB up and posting correctly (5432)
Backend functioning properly (8080)

What is not yet achieved?

React frontend needs to be re-built (functional, nothing fancy)
- Two pages (home page, data page)
- Home page real barebones just to learn MaterialUI
- Data page will show all current DB entries and let you add new one, that's literally it (+ some design stuff)
- Integrate MaterialUI designs to frontend
Add JUnit testing to backend
Add Mocha testing to frontend
Learn Docker then implement
Learn Jenkins then implement
Learn Kubernetes then implement
Host on AWS
